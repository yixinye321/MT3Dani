# MT3Dani
1. This code is an finite element modeling program with unstructured mesh for solving the 3D MT problem in anisotropic media using A-phi potentials.
 
2. The unstructured tetrahedral meshes used in the FE method were created  using the TetGen mesh generator.

3. The resulting sparse linear system of equations is solved by using the  symmetric successive over-relaxation preconditioned conjugate gradient (SSOR-PCG) method.

4.  The programme is written in language Fortran 90, and performed in Linux on the personal computer with double-cored 2.9 GHz CPU and 8 GB RAM.

5. Three files are needed to exacute the programme, one is the "RUNFILE", which inputs the parameters for MT responses computations, another one is the ".node" file, which consists of coordinates of all vertices in the mesh, and the third one is the element file “.ele”  that contains all the element in the mesh. The ".node" and “.ele” are the mesh files generated by the tetrahedral mesh generator TetGen.

6. The ".mt" file is output results of the MT responses calculated using the programme.
